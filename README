abuntix is an ubuntu derivative, to be installed over a fresh install
of Ubuntu Desktop 12.10.

bakim is a script for backing up files which are expected to never
change (music files, videos, disk images, etc.)

Some day it'll get updated. But not today, this line only exists so
that there will be a change to try git-appraise on.
